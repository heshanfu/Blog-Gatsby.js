*In this article, we are going to see why and how to improve your way to learn.*

---

We are living in a constantly changing world. In this moving environment, the need to learn fast and efficiently becomes more and more obvious. When it comes to Data Science or Software Engineering for example, big concepts remain but technologies are evolving so fast that you have no choice but to constantly update your knowledge.

So I wanted to learn more about... how to learn. I fortunately found a great course given by Barbara Oakley from Oakland University and Terry Sejnowski from the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory of Salk Institute. The course provides keys to understand the different learning processes and how cognitive and neuroscience findings can help you to hack your way to learn. Interested? Let's deep dive in your brain.

## I. Understand your brain

There are a million billion synapses in your brain where memories are stored. The old view of the brain is that once it matures, the strengths of synapses can be adjusted by learning, but the pattern of connectivity does not change much unless there is brain damage. But now we know that brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures.

## II. Defeat procrastination

## III. The power of repetition and constancy

Think of your neural structure like your muscle mass. If you plan to grow and build an athletic body, working out for ten hours once a month won't work well. Building muscle mass requires short and effective workout everyday, allowing you to learn motion patterns and to gradually overload your sessions. So building an effective neural structure requires this little work everyday to build an appetite for learning, and to gradually get better at what you're studying.


## IV. The impact of your lifestyle

## V. Intelligence in the big data and web era

I tried to figure out what definition we could give to intelligence in the era of fully available data and knowledge.
In my opinion, we could think modern human intelligence as your own knowledge plus your ability to find out how to solve a problem on Google in let's say... 30 seconds. So learning how to learn is necessary, but you'd also better learn how to make researches to take advantage of the massive and increasing knowledge available online.
Finally, I think you should focus on understanding concepts first, the idea is to get that transversal knowledge that can scale to any new tool. But you also have to learn with a tool, or try to implement what you're learning in a little project so you can assess your knowledge and show the world your way to use it,
