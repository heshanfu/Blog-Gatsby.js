Clustering des inputs pour découvrir des similirarités pour grouper des phrases ayant le même sens. On va attribuer un même intent à ce groupe.

## AI or not AI, the fantasm of the conversasional chatbot
### No AI
Nowadays, all chatbots are not necessarelly AIs. You could imagine a form designed as a chatbot talking to you, with prebuilt answers. This is widely done to enhance user experience and increase the conversion.

### Weak AI
A weak AI is smtg capable of being very efficient for a given task, or in a very specific context (e.g. order a pizza).

### Strong AI
A strong AI is smtg capable of being very efficient whatever the task or the context.
If weak AI are very common, strong AI is a true fantasm left to GAFAs.
In the case of chatbots, a strong conversationnal chatbot would be very deceptive for users as it won't be able to handle every situations. Chatbots which works well are transactionnal.
