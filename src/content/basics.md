*In this article, we'll cover the very basic concepts you need to start a curriculum in Data Science.*

---

First of all, I'd like to make sure you don't feel like you can't start a career because of maths. It is widely proven to be false for most business applications. In data science projects, the highly statistical work is just a part of the value chain. Moreover, it happens - sometimes - that best results come from iterations rather than statistical hypotheses.

In this article, I'll try to focus on the very basics you'll need to start. Of course, as Data Science can be applied to a large number of fields, some of them will require a specific knowledge that you'll have to learn if you consider a career in the industry.

Also, keep it mind that you'll probably have to dive deeper in some mathematical concepts if you want to fully understand what's happening behind the high-level APIs you'll use while coding data science projects.

> *Disclaimer: If you consider a career of post-doctoral research, you'll have to.*

Enough talking, let me introduce you to your new familiar math concepts.

## The Bayes Theorem

Coming soon.

## The Normal Law/Distribution
Which is the idea that every random phenomena tend to follow a normal distrbution. If you want a good proof of concept, please watch this extract from a great conference made by Cedric Villani:
